      <h3 class="accordion-title">How To Use</h3>
      <div class="accordion-content">


        <p>Unlock the true potential of persona fusion with this step-by-step guide on how to effectively use the
          Persona 4 Fusion Calculator:</p>

        <h3>Step 1: Select Persona</h3>
        <p>Start by accessing the Persona 4 Fusion Calculator. Choose the persona you want to fuse or explore fusion
          recipes for. You can either scroll through the persona list or use the search function to find a specific
          persona. This allows you to focus on the persona you want to enhance or create.</p>

        <p>For example, let's say you have the persona "Pixie" and want to explore its fusion possibilities. Use the
          search function or scroll through the list to find "Pixie."</p>

        <h3>Step 2: View Fusion Recipes</h3>
        <p>Once you have selected a persona, the Fusion Calculator will display a list of fusion recipes associated with
          that persona. These recipes represent the combinations of personas required to create the desired persona.
          Take your time to review the fusion recipes and explore the available fusion options.</p>

        <p>For "Pixie," the Fusion Calculator might reveal fusion recipes such as fusing "Pixie" with "Angel" to create
          the persona "Archangel." Another recipe might involve fusing "Pixie" with a specific combination of personas
          to create a powerful persona with unique skills and abilities.</p>

        <h3>Step 3: Obtain Required Personas</h3>
        <p>Before you can perform a fusion, make sure you have obtained all the necessary personas involved in the
          fusion recipe. If any of the required personas are missing from your collection, refer back to the Fusion
          Calculator to identify the specific personas you need to acquire. This step is crucial for a successful
          fusion.</p>

        <p>Continuing our example, if a fusion recipe requires "Angel," make sure you have already acquired it. If not,
          consult the Fusion Calculator for "Angel's" fusion recipe and gather the required personas to fuse and create
          "Angel" before proceeding with the desired fusion involving "Pixie."</p>

        <h3>Step 4: Perform Fusion</h3>
        <p>With the required personas in your possession, it's time to perform the fusion. Follow the fusion recipe
          details provided by the Fusion Calculator. These details will specify which personas need to be fused together
          and the resulting persona that will be created. Pay close attention to the personas' levels, arcana, and any
          additional instructions mentioned in the fusion recipe.</p>

        <p>Returning to our example, let's say you have "Pixie" and "Angel" in your inventory. Follow the fusion recipe
          provided by the Fusion Calculator, which might instruct you to fuse "Pixie" and "Angel" together at a specific
          fusion location. By following the instructions and confirming the fusion process, you'll witness the birth of
          the new persona, such as "Archangel."</p>

        <h3>Step 5: Evaluate Resulting Persona</h3>
        <p>After the fusion is complete, take a moment to evaluate the resulting persona. Consider its new skills,
          abilities, and attributes. Assess whether it aligns with your desired playstyle or complements your current
          party's strengths and weaknesses. This evaluation will help you determine if the fusion was successful and if
          the resulting persona fits into your overall strategy.</p>

        <p>Analyze the strengths and weaknesses of "Archangel." Does it possess powerful light-based skills that can be
          advantageous in certain battles? Does it bring unique support abilities or stat boosts that can complement
          your team composition? Consider these factors to determine if the fusion was successful and how the resulting
          persona can contribute to your gameplay strategy.</p>

        <p>Persona fusion is an iterative process, so feel free to repeat these steps, explore different fusion recipes,
          and experiment with various personas. The Persona 4 Fusion Calculator is a valuable tool that will assist you
          in optimizing your fusion strategy and enhancing your gameplay experience.</p>

        <p>Now that you're familiar with the steps, venture forth into the world of persona fusion with confidence.
          Unleash the full potential of your personas and overcome any challenges that await you in Persona 4!</p>
