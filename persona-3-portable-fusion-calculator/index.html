      <h3 class="accordion-title">How to Use</h3>
      <div class="accordion-content">

        <p>Unlock the secrets of persona fusion with this comprehensive step-by-step guide on how to effectively use the
          Persona 3 Portable Fusion Calculator:</p>

        <h3>Step 1: Select Persona</h3>
        <img class="accordion-img" src="../images/Select-Persona-in-Persona-3-Portable.webp"
          alt="Select Persona in Persona 3 Portable">
        <p>To begin, access the Persona 3 Portable Fusion Calculator. Choose the persona you wish to fuse or explore
          fusion recipes for. You can browse through the persona list or utilize the search function to find a specific
          persona. This allows you to focus on the persona you want to enhance or create.</p>

        <p>For example, let's say you have the persona "Pixie" and want to discover its fusion possibilities. Use the
          search function or scroll through the list to find "Pixie."</p>

        <h3>Step 2: View Fusion Recipes</h3>
        <img class="accordion-img" src="../images/View-Fusion-Recipes-in-Persona-3-Portable.webp"
          alt="View Fusion Recipes in Persona 3 Portable" loading="lazy" width="1080" height="699">
        <p>Once you have selected a persona, the Fusion Calculator will display a list of fusion recipes associated with
          that persona. These recipes represent the combinations of personas required to create the desired persona.
          Take your time to carefully review the fusion recipes and explore the available fusion options.</p>

        <p>For "Pixie," the Fusion Calculator might reveal fusion recipes such as fusing "Pixie" with "Jack Frost" to
          create the persona "High Pixie." Another recipe might involve fusing "Pixie" with a specific combination of
          personas to create a powerful persona with unique skills and abilities.</p>

        <h3>Step 3: Obtain Required Personas</h3>
        <img class="accordion-img"
          src="/fusion-calculator.xyz/images/Obtain-Required-Personas-in-Persona-3-Portable-Remaster.webp"
          alt="Obtain Required Personas" loading="lazy" width="1428" height="744">
        <p>Before you can perform a fusion, ensure that you have obtained all the necessary personas involved in the
          fusion recipe. If any of the required personas are missing from your collection, refer back to the Fusion
          Calculator to identify the specific personas you need to acquire. This step is crucial for a successful
          fusion.</p>

        <p>Following our example, if a fusion recipe requires "Jack Frost," make sure you have already acquired it. If
          not, consult the Fusion Calculator for "Jack Frost's" fusion recipe and gather the required personas to fuse
          and create "Jack Frost" before proceeding with the desired fusion involving "Pixie."</p>

        <h3>Step 4: Perform Fusion</h3>
        <img class="accordion-img" src="../images/Perform-Fusion-in-Persona-3-Portable.webp"
          alt="Perform Fusion in Persona 3 Portable" loading="lazy" width="1920" height="1080">
        <p>With the required personas in your possession, it's time to perform the fusion. Follow the fusion recipe
          details provided by the Fusion Calculator. These details will specify which personas need to be fused together
          and the resulting persona that will be created. Pay close attention to the personas' levels, arcana, and any
          additional instructions mentioned in the fusion recipe.</p>

        <p>Returning to our example, let's say you have "Pixie" and "Jack Frost" in your inventory. Follow the fusion
          recipe provided by the Fusion Calculator, which might instruct you to fuse "Pixie" and "Jack Frost" together
          at a specific fusion location. By following the instructions and confirming the fusion process, you'll witness
          the birth of the new persona, such as "High Pixie."</p>

        <h3>Step 5: Evaluate Resulting Persona</h3>
        <p>After the fusion is complete, take a moment to evaluate the resulting persona. Consider its new skills,
          abilities, and attributes. Assess whether it aligns with your desired playstyle or complements your current
          party's strengths and weaknesses. This evaluation will help you determine if the fusion was successful and if
          the resulting persona fits into your overall strategy.</p>

        <p>Analyze the strengths and weaknesses of "High Pixie." Does it possess powerful magic-based skills that can be
          advantageous in certain battles? Does it bring unique support abilities or stat boosts that can complement
          your team composition? Take these factors into consideration to determine if the fusion was successful and how
          the resulting persona can contribute to your gameplay strategy.</p>

        <p>Keep in mind that persona fusion is an iterative process. Feel free to repeat these steps, explore different
          fusion recipes, and experiment with various personas. The Persona 3 Portable Fusion Calculator is an
          invaluable tool that will assist you in optimizing your fusion strategy and enhancing your gameplay
          experience.</p>

        <p>Now that you're familiar with the steps, venture forth with confidence into the world of persona fusion.
          Unleash the full potential of your personas and overcome any challenges that lie in your path in Persona 3
          Portable!</p>
